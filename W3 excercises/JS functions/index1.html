      //1. Write a JavaScript function that reverse a number.
      //Example x = 32243;
      //Expected Output : 34223

      //console.log("-----------------------");
      //2. Write a JavaScript function that checks whether a passed string is palindrome or not?
      //A palindrome is word, phrase, or sequence that reads the same backward as forward, e.g., madam or nurses run.

      //3. Write a JavaScript function that generates all combinations of a string. Go to the editor
      //Example string : 'dog'
      //Expected Output : d,do,dog,o,og,g
